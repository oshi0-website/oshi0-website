				<h1><b>Children's Ministry</b></h1>
				
				<image src="image/kaeanapoint.jpg" style="height: 75%; width: 75%;">
				</br>
				<h2><b>Sunday School<b></h2>
				<p>
				Every Sunday from 9:37-10:27, Our Savior's children are welcome to join us at Sunday School. 
				During Sunday School, we spend time learning about the Bible stories we have heard during worship. 
				Through games, storytime, crafts, and other activities, children engage in faith forming activities that connect them to the love of Jesus.
				</p>

				
				<h2><b>Nursery<b></h2>
				<p>
				During worship, Our Savior's littlest ones (babies-kindergarten) are welcome to our nursery off of the narthex. 
				Staffed by volunteers, the nursery is equipped with age appropriate toys, books, and activities. 
				Please be sure to sign your child in and out. 
				You can also find our changing table here.  
				There are Sundays when the nursery is not staffed (we don't always have enough volunteers).  
				You are welcome to stay in the nursery with your little one and watch the service on the monitor.  
				You are also welcome to volunteer for the nursery team so we can keep the nursery open every Sunday.
				</p>
				
				<h2><b>Worship</b></h2>
				<p>
				No one is too young to join us in worship. 
				During each service, children are welcome to come to the front and participate in a children's message. 
				In the back of the church, children's activities and crayons are also available for your child during the service. 
				We welcome all children to our services and are happy to support you in whatever way we can to make worship a special time to be gathered as family.
				</p>
				
				<h2><b>Vacation Bible eXperience</b></h2>
				<p>
				Each summer, children (PK-4th grade) gather for a week of Vacation Bible eXperience at Our Savior. 
				During this week, children engage in Bible stories, music, games, and activities as they discover in exciting ways the great love Jesus as for them.  
				VBX usually takes place right after school gets out in June.  
				Keep an eye on the calendar for the dates!

					<p>
					We gather from 6:00 - 7:30PM on the 2nd and 4th
					Tuesday of each month for food, games, fun with
					friends, and interactive Bible Experiences.
					<p>
					
					<h2><b>Fun Fridays</b></h2>
					<p>
					Once a quarter, we meet on a Friday night for fun 
					in and out of the youth room.
					</p>
					
					<h2><b>Half-Day Hullabaloo</b></h2>
					<p>
					On select Minimum Days, we get together for 
					crazy fun when school lets out.
					</p>

					Once a semester, we join forces with the Senior 
					High to serve our community.
