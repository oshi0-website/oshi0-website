		Two years after Hawaii gained statehood, the Aiea-Halawa area experienced incredible growth. 
		The sugar cane fields that once covered the landscape gave way to houses and businesses. 
		The Lutheran Mission Council of Hawaii assigned Vicar John Kellogg of Concordia Seminary, Springfield, Illinois, to begin work in the area. 
		His efforts soon resulted in the first worship service of what would become Our Savior Lutheran Church on February 5, 1961. 
		The 50 people who met at Alvah Scott Elementary School became the nucleus of the newest Lutheran church on O'ahu. 
		They were people of faith and vision, planning and action. 
		And through their work, the congregation recorded a number of firsts: the first Sunday School (36 in attendance), the first purchase of property in the shadow of Leeward Hospital (now Pali Momi Medical Center), the first congregational meeting, the first Communion service and the first Baptism: Ramona Lynn Hundtoft. 
		With the congregation numbering 71 souls and 30 communicants, Vicar Kellogg departed for the Mainland to complete his seminary education.<br/>

		After worshipping at Alvah Scott School for almost 2 years, the congregation broke ground in January of 1963, for a new sanctuary. 
		The new building cost $51,000, a major obligation for the young congregation, but the load was eased by donations from congregations across the Mainland. 
		The bell that hangs in the bell tower at the front of the church was donated by the Oahu Sugar Refinery.  
		It had been used to call sugar workers to rest at the end of the day, now it called worshippers to the Lord's House for worship. 
		The bell no longer  resounds with a clear ring because of years of corrosion, but is occasionally rung to commemorate special events. 
		It last rang on the day of prayer during the First Persian Gulf war.

		In March 1970, the Voter's Assembly decided to open a preschool.  
		33 students were enrolled the following September.  
		Our Savior currently offers Preschool through 8th grade.
